# Sanskrit-to-English Translator

Welcome to the Sanskrit-to-English Translator. 

We have used the OpenNMT, an open source ecosystem for neural machine translation (NMT), to build a Sanskrit-to-English translation model. We trained and tested 28 different NMT models. This repository also contains the the web app we have developed to host the translation model. Thw web app was built using the Flask (Python) framework, and deployed through Heroku.

We also submitted our work to the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL). Here's a [copy of our submission](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPKLqxzZLZdQjxb8s-I86FNg7ubeH9c1/view?usp=sharing).

This is an academic project based out of Samskrita Bharati USA. [Visit our website](http://sanskrittranslator.herokuapp.com/).
