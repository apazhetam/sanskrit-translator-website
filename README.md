# Sanskrit-to-English Translator

Welcome to the Sanskrit-to-English Translator. 

We have used OpenNMT, an open source ecosystem for neural machine translation (NMT), to build a Sanskrit-to-English translation model. In the process of improving our final model, we curated a parallel corpus of thousands of sentences in Sanskrit and English, and trained and tested 28 different NMT models. This repository  contains the web app we have developed to host the translation model. The web app was built using the Flask (Python) framework, and deployed through Heroku.

We also submitted our work to the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL). Here's a [copy of our submission](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPKLqxzZLZdQjxb8s-I86FNg7ubeH9c1/view?usp=sharing).

This is an academic project based out of Samskrita Bharati USA. [Visit our website](http://sanskrittranslator.herokuapp.com/).
